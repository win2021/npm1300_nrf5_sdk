 *
 * @details The algorithm determines the predicted state-of-charge (SOC) based on the following
 * data: specific model of the battery type used in the application along with
 * measurements of battery voltage, current, and temperature.
 * The SOC is a value between 0% and 100%.
 *
 * @note Current and voltage measurements do not have to be made at a certain interval.
 *       However, the two values should be measured as closely as possible in time.

 *          If this function is not called,
 *          discharge current in low power states may be over-estimated.
 *          For example, consider a system that enters a state where only the low frequency
 *          oscillator is running to generate a wakeup sometime later. To minimize the power usage
 *          during this period, no battery measurements are made. The idle current is likely
 *          to be too low to accurately measure dynamically, but it is known ahead of time.
 *          Using this function with the expected average current will help the library
 *          more accurately predict the power drain during the idle, low-power period.
 *          When activity is resumed, use @ref nrf_fuel_gauge_process as normal.
 *
 * @note Make sure this function is called from the same context as @ref nrf_fuel_gauge_process.
 *
 * @param v Measured battery voltage in volts [V].
