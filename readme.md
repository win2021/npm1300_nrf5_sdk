+ This sample code base on nrf52 SDK 17.1.0

+ The hardware testting base on nrf52 DK + NPM1300 EK:
     1. nrf52 DK P0.26(SDA) -> nPM1300 EK SDA, 
     2. nrf52 DK P0.27(SCL) -> nPM1300 EK SCL, 
     3. GND -> GND
     
+ Make the following connections on the nPM1300 EK:
      1. Connect a USB power supply to the J3 connector.
      2. Connect a suitable battery to the J2 connector.
      3. On the P18 pin header, connect VOUT2 and VDDIO pins with a jumper.
      4. On the P2 pin header, connect VBAT and VBATIN pins with a jumper.
      5. On the P17 pin header, connect all LEDs with jumpers.
      6. On the P13 pin header, connect RSET1 and VSET1 pins with a jumper.
      7. On the P14 pin header, connect RSET2 and VSET2 pins with a jumper.
